# Handwriting-Recognition

As people have different handwriting it is difficult for a computer or any device to understand those handwritings of different people. The handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer or a device to take input handwriting in the form of an image such as picture of handwritten text which is fed to the pattern recognition algorithm or a model. And this model recognizes the handwritten digits.

Here I have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize the handwritten digits. I have used MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database of handwritten digits as an input to these models to recognize the digits. The CNN model performs well which has accuracy of 99%.

----  Project Overview

As we know that all of us have different handwriting styles such as different strokes to represent a same letter, the amount of pressure given on paper to write something. All these things differs the handwriting of an individual.

For the humans to recognize the digits such as 0, 1, 2… it is easy for them, even if they have written differently. It is because they have millions of neurons present in the brain, which helps humans to easily recognize the data. But for a computer to understand these different handwriting it is difficult for them. So handwriting recognition systems were developed.

I have researched on Neural Network model, a model which was inspired from the neurons present in our brain. And a SVM classifier a supervised machine learning model to recognize the digits. I have used Python as a language to implement these machine learning models.

What is SVM?

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression problem. But it is mostly used for classification purpose. Let’s say we have given 2 or more labeled classes of data, a SVM classifies those different classes by drawing an optimal hyperplane that separates all the classes.

A hyperplane is drawn in such a way that it is at a midpoint between the classes. A hyperplane is a linear decision surface that splits the space into two parts.
